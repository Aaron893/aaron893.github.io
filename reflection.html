                Having a responsive design means that the web features are responding just right based on the user's environment, platform,
                and oriented, by having flexible layouts, and intelligence in CSS. for example when switching devices, the website should 
                automatically respond to the user's preferences.
                For example, it should be responsive to the needs of phone users as they would see the content in single column view;as well as tablet users as they might show the same content in two columns.They also work on a single, flexible design that can be adjustable to fit the screen. Responsive design is based on three fundamental principles which are media queries,fluid grids and fluid image.

                Web technology itself is classified in a different section as WWW, Web browsers, Web servers, Web pages, etc. for web development, some languages are required including HTML, CSS, etc. HTML and CSS are the fundamentals for building web pages. HTML is mainly used for building its structures and CSS for style and layout.

                A web app needs to be able to interact and function in a manner to work on multiple devices. and it's the developer's responsibility to know each device's strengths and weaknesses in order to figure out the behaviour of its web app. For Modern web design, it is important that the site can adapt with any screen size or even respond to different features of different devices as it varies in each of them. Only by using the right principles while designing the web, it can be done in ways that the website can be defined and displayed on mobile platforms, like smartphones, and tablets, or even larger screens. I realised that not all web apps might not be able to work on a browser or anywhere on any other devices, desktops or other platforms. because the web-runtime environment islinked with the app and thus can be distributed to a mobile device through app servers.

                    During this course, By doing the assignment I realised that making web applications for cross-platform devices is difficult and complex. by doing this I got to learn and have an understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I also got to learn about some frameworks in CSS for it is necessary for the appearance of the websites that I had to make. A lot of extra work is needed to be done to select the appropriate way to implement JS for logic and CSS for making it attractive and stylish by the developer. All in all, I got to learn about responsive designing and using it to make one I learned how to make some simple and basic websites using simple tags. In short, I learned how web developers build and maintain websites.
